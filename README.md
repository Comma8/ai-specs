## What This Repo Is

This repository defines how I expect to interact with AI systems.

It is not a collection of clever prompts. It is a set of **behavioral contracts, thinking standards, and interaction rules** that govern how models should reason, critique, and collaborate with me.

Think of this as an alignment layer between how AI systems default to behaving and how I actually want to work.


## Core Documents

### `soul.md`

The constitution.

This file defines non‑negotiable principles that apply to *all* interactions:

* Honesty over politeness
* Opinions over hedging
* Critical thinking over reassurance
* Momentum over analysis paralysis

If a rule applies everywhere, it belongs in `soul.md`.



## How to Use This Repo

### Starting a New Conversation

At the start of a new AI conversation:

1. Paste the contents of `soul.md`
2. Say something equivalent to:

> "Use `soul.md` as governing interaction rules for this conversation."

This establishes the highest possible instruction priority.



### Ongoing Conversations

If behavior drifts, a simple reminder is sufficient:

> "Operate under soul.md."



## What This Repo Is Not

* Not a personality prompt
* Not a safety framework
* Not a prompt marketplace
* Not documentation for end users

This repo exists to improve **thinking quality**, not tone compliance.



## Design Principles

* Signal over noise
* Depth over speed (unless speed materially matters)
* Alternatives over false dichotomies
* Historical context when it improves reasoning
* Explicit uncertainty over confident guessing





## Guiding Question

At every step, the goal is simple:

> Does this interaction make my thinking sharper, faster, or more honest?

If not, it’s noise.
